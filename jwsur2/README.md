Java Web Services: Up and Running, 2e

A "Mavenized" version of the code exists on the branch 'jwsur2-maven'. It started as a contribution from a reader of the book and is not actively maintained by Martin Kalin. Although very similar, it is not an exact replica of the main branch. The code is a work-in-progress and is solely meant for educational purposes; the author of the code assumes no responsibility for it's correctness, completeness or quality. The same usage agreements apply to the Maven branch as the main one.

<dl>
  <dt>System Requirements for the Maven branch:</dt>
  <dd>Java 1.7.0 or above</dd>
  <dd>Maven 3.0 or above</dd>
</dl>

The Maven branch uses embedded Jetty for deployment.

  <dt>Note: These projects share few common utilities that are not part of the books original code and hence not been included in this repository. You are, however, free to navigate to the author's GitHub repo and get those if you'd like.</dt>
